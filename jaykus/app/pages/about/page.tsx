                    hi, i&#39;m jayden, a software engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia (at the moment) with a burning passion to have a great cv and look somewhat competent. i enjoy spending my time doing things i will not regret later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i have experience in frontend development although my designs are as beautiful as drying paint. lately, i have explored backend development. this website is made using the next.js framework with tailwind css framework, hosted on vercel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i was also a video game developer actively participating in game jams, but i do not pride myself in visual arts (my games look like sh&#39;t). i will not further disclose this.
                </p>

            <h2 className="text-6xl md:text-9xl font-bold mb-4">music</h2>
            <div className="text-lg md:text-3xl space-y-6">
                <p>
                    i also play musical instruments such as the guitars, bass, piano, and drums (somewhat). i am a decent instrumentalist however i have little musical creativity. i can easily transcribe or arrange music but i am working on creating listenable music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i try to create content with my musical abilities but i will not participate in polluting the internet with my terrible visual appearance. i will create more musical content once i look tolerable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    as the kid of the owner of hiendguitar, i have almost unlimited access to every part of the local music industry, which allows me to document and publicize content not a lot of people are able to. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    being the heir of hiendguitar, i play only the best of instruments. i have unlimited access to the top guitars ever made. criticize my skills all you like but 99% of you will never hold the guitars i get to. the guitars i hold are the best and only the best. criticize my guitars and you are simply too poor.
